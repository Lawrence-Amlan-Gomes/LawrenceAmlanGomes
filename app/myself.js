About Me:

I am Lawrence Amlan Gomes, a dedicated Full-Stack Developer based in Dhaka, Bangladesh, 
passionate about crafting scalable, user-centric web applications. With expertise in modern 
technologies like React, Next.js, and GraphQL, I build responsive, high-performance solutions 
that drive business success. My focus on clean code, intuitive design, and innovative 
integrations—such as Framer Motion animations and secure payment gateways—ensures seamless 
user experiences across devices.

Projects:

I have developed a dynamic personal portfolio website featuring blogs, project showcases, 
and interactive contact forms. Notable projects include a landing page with social media 
integrations, a contact form with MongoDB for secure message storage, and an AI-powered chatbot 
leveraging real-time Firebase capabilities. Additionally, I’ve built secure registration forms 
with validation and hashing, as well as e-commerce features integrated with payment gateways 
like Stripe and PayPal, all optimized for performance and scalability.

Skills:

Proficient in full-stack development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, and Tailwind 
CSS for crafting responsive, modern frontends. I leverage Framer Motion for engaging animations
 and Redux with Redux Toolkit for efficient state management. On the backend, I specialize in 
 MongoDB and GraphQL for scalable data management and API performance, with expertise in Firebase 
 for real-time features. I also integrate secure payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal), implement 
 form validation, handle server-side actions via APIs, and ensure cross-platform compatibility with 
 responsive designs.

Clients:

I have collaborated with individual clients and small businesses on freelance projects, delivering 
custom web applications and portfolio websites. Key engagements include developing interactive user 
interfaces for startup prototypes, optimizing web performance for existing sites, and integrating 
secure payment solutions to enhance e-commerce functionality, consistently meeting client goals with
 tailored, high-quality solutions.

Blogs:

I regularly write about cutting-edge web development topics, including Next.js server-side 
rendering, Tailwind CSS for rapid UI design, and advanced React hooks for reusable components. 
My blog posts, accessible via the "View All Blogs" link on my portfolio, also cover UI/UX best 
practices, GraphQL API integration, and implementing dark/light theme toggles, offering insights
 to developers and businesses alike.

Experience:

With over two years of hands-on experience as a self-taught Full-Stack Developer, I have progressed 
from building HTML/CSS websites to delivering complex full-stack applications with MongoDB, GraphQL,
 and Firebase integrations. I actively contribute to open-source projects on GitHub, explore 
 AI-driven web functionalities, and specialize in frontend development with a strong backend 
 foundation, ensuring robust and scalable solutions.
